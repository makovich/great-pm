            <li>Real software is what runs on computers. This means that real software is not C++ (or any other programming language).</li>
            <li>Real software is built by computers (via compilers and linkers).</li>
            <li>This means that a source code listing (in any programming language) is really a software design.</li>
            <li>It follows from the above that real software is incredibly cheap to build, and getting cheaper all the time as computers get faster.</li>
            <li>Software is incredibly expensive to design. This is true in both an absolute sense (because of its ever increasing complexity), and relative to the cost of a software build.</li>
            <li>Programming is a design activity &mdash; a good software design process recognizes this and doesn't hesitate to code when coding makes sense.</li>
        </ul>
