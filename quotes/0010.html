        Thirty years ago Yourdon and Constantine in Structured Design
        identified economics as the underlying driver of software design.
        Software should be designed to reduce its overall cost.
        The cost of software is divided into the initial cost and the cost of maintenance:
        <span style="display: block; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0;">
            $<sub>total</sub> = $<sub>develop</sub> + $<sub>maintain</sub>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the industry gained experience with software development,
        it was a big surprise to many that the cost of maintenance is much higher
        than the cost of initial development.
        Maintenance is expensive because understanding existing code is time-consuming and error-prone.
        Making changes is generally easy when you know what needs changing.
        Learning what the current code does is the expensive part.
        Once the changes are made, they need to be tested and deployed.
        <span style="display: block; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0;">
            $<sub>maintain</sub> = $<sub>understand</sub> + $<sub>change</sub> + $<sub>test</sub> + $<sub>deploy</sub>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        My strategy for reducing overall costs is to ask all programmers
        to address the cost of understanding code during the maintenance phase
        by focusing on communicating, programmer-to-programmer.
        The immediate benefits of clear code are fewer defects,
        easier sharing of code, and smoother development.
