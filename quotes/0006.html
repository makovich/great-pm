        In Software engineering, the Laws of Software Evolution
        refer to a series of laws that Lehman and Belady formulated starting in 1974
        with respect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_evolution" target="_blank">Software evolution</a>.
        The laws describe a balance between forces driving new developments on one hand,
        and forces that slow down progress on the other hand.
