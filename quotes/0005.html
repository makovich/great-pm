        McConnell related an incident that occurred at a CMM Level 5 firm, Telcordia.
        They had a 1-million-plus-source-line system that had to be modified
        due to a decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
        The change required about 3,000 lines of code to be created or modified.
        The changes were made, and no errors were reported in the first year of use.
        While this is remarkable by itself, there's more to the story.
        The company had undergone growth of about 40 percent,
        to 3,500 management and technical personnel, within the 18 months
        prior to the changes having to be made in the code.
        The most impressive part of the story is that the changes cited were made in just one 9-hour day.
        That's right, less than one flow day.
        So the next time someone remarks that this process improvement stuff is OK
        when things are going well but not in an emergency, just remember Telcordia.
