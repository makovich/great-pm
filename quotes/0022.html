        Your team's culture is much like a good loaf of sourdough:
        your starter culture (your founders) inoculates your dough (your newcomers) with the culture,
        and as the yeast and bacteria (your team members) grow, out pops a great loaf of bread (your team).
        If your starter culture is strong, it's more than capable of overcoming any undesirable "wild strains" of culture
        that a newcomer might bring with him. If your starter culture is weak,
        your team is vulnerable to unknown culture strains that newcomers might bring along.
        Unknown cultures bring with them unpredictable results, so it's better to start with a known starter culture.
