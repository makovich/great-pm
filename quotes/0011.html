        Bruce Feiler has a radical idea: To deal with the stress of modern family life, go agile.
        Inspired by agile software programming, Feiler introduces family practices
        which encourage flexibility, bottom-up idea flow, constant feedback and accountability.
        One surprising feature: Kids pick their own punishments.
