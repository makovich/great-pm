## Are you a [great.pm](http://makovich.github.io/great-pm/)? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makovich/great-pm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makovich/great-pm)

We are dealing here with a crucial difference between a living system and a machine. A machine can be controlled; a living system can only be disturbed. Mechanistically oriented managers tend to hold on to the belief that they can control the organization if they understand how all its parts fit together. <...>

Organizations cannot be controlled through direct interventions, but they can be influenced by giving impulses rather than instructions. To change the conventional style of management accordingly requires a shift of perception that is anything but easy, but it also brings great rewards. <...>

There is no need to push, pull, or bully it to make it change. Force, or energy, are not the issue; the issue is meaning. Meaningful disturbances will get the organization's attention and will trigger structural changes.

### Disclaimer

This is not about project management per se (however, it is a good thing to manage *Project* as opposed to *People*).

This project was a *funky way to learn front-end engineering* majesty:
- mad and rarely used HTML tags with cross-browsering in mind;
- assets pre- and post-processing with help of tasks runner;
- CSS inlining, web-fonts preloading, images concatenating and base64ing to make page load friendly enough;
- deploying to GitHub Pages with Travis CI right after git push.

All these small but very important pieces together had become my motive to create this site. Enjoy!
